# Advanced R Programming Course Project


This is the course project for Coursera's [Advanced R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-r) class offered by the Johns Hopkins University.

The repo includes the following files:

**Part 1: Factorial Function**

* `factorial_code.R`: R script file that contains  four different versions of the Factorial function and that calculates a summary of their performance
* `factorial_output.txt`: text file produced by `factorial_code.R` that contains the results of the comparison of the four different implementations

**Part 2: Longitudinal Data Class and Methods**

* `oop_code.R`: R script file that contains the code implementing classes, methods, and generics for the longitudinal dataset

* `oop_output.R`: R script that sources `oop_code.R` and that produces the console output saved in `oop_output.txt`. 
* `oop_output.txt`: a text file containing the console output produced by running `oop_output.R`. The console output was added manually via copy&paste to the file.
